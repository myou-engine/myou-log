# MyouLog

Do you forget to start or stop your work logger when you get focused or distracted? Do you have difficulties to remember how much time did you spend since then? Do you forget to set a timer to start or limit your breaks?

If you ansered yes, MyouLog, _the work logger for the absent-minded_, is for you.

## Questions window
__MyouLog will ask you__ every 5 minutes (configurable) if you are working and what are you working on. But don't worry, the questions and the UI are __designed to avoid distractactions__ and answering will usually take less than a second, with just a click or a keypress. After not answering for 5 minutes (configurable), it will assume you were distracted during that time.
